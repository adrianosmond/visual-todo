# Visual To-Do

This is a project (still in progress) for the autistic children at my sister's school. Traditional to-do lists provide them with too much information at one time. This aims to simplify that, showing only what they need to do now and next. This also allows the teachers to create a catalogue of things (say, items for a shopping list) which they can then select and load onto the child's iPad.

## Work still to be done
- Add items to the list from the catalogue of items
- Remove items from the list from the catalogue of items
- Change the order of items in the list
- Download the list into localStorage so it can be used offline on an iPad
- Visual design
- Write test suite

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
